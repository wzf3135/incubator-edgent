/**
 * {@code DirectProvider} is a {@link TopologyProvider} that

 * <P> 
 * A job (execution of a topology) continues to execute
 * while any of its elements have remaining work,
 * such as any of the topology's source streams are capable
 * of generating tuples.
 * <BR>
 * "Endless" source streams never terminate - e.g., a stream
 * created by {@link Topology#generate(quarks.function.Supplier) generate()},
 * {@link Topology#poll(quarks.function.Supplier, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit) poll()},
 * or {@link Topology#events(quarks.function.Consumer) events()}.
